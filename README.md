What The Code Does: This code creates a webpage that works links with a third-party API called OpenWeatherMap. Essentially, the user can enter in any city of their choice and get the current weather for that city. Additionally, the user has the option to engage in a site-wide chatbox where they can talk about the weather or anything that so pleases them. On top of this, when the weather is returned to the user, the site returns a cheeky message based on the temperature of the chosen city.

Motivation: The motivation for this project (apart from being a required final project) was that I based it off of another iPhone app by the name of AuthenticWeather. That app is brilliant and credits go to Tobias van Schneider for his great work. I have no intentions of ever publishing this work or taking credit for the idea.
